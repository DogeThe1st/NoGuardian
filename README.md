# About
This is just a simple method to get around certain types of work/school restrictions.
It may not work all the time, as this only bypasses censoring via checking the url of the page.
It works by just displaying the selected webpage through an IFrame.
I may turn this into a collection of pages!

# How to
On the page, scroll down to the website selection textbox. Type a website (Ex: 2player.co), and press submit.
This website will default to using HTTPS, so it may not work for HTTP only sites.
